# Your first Progressive Web App Code Lab

These are the resource files needed for the [Your first Progressive Web App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/)
code lab from Google.

This is a work in progress, if you find a mistake, please [file an issue](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/your-first-pwapp/issues). Thanks!

## What you’ll learn
* How to design and construct an app using the “app shell” method
* How to make your app work offline
* How to store data for use offline later

## What you’ll need
* Chrome 52 or above, though any browser that supports service workers and `cache.addAll()` will work
* [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb), or use your own web server of choice.
* The [sample code](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/your-first-pwapp/archive/master.zip)
* A text editor
* Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* (Optional) Node is required in the last step to deploy to Firebase
